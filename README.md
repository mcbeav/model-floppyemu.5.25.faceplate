# FloppyEMU 5.25" Floppy Disk Faceplate

Model for a custom FloppyEMU case made from a repurposed Apple 5.25" floppy disk drive. (*The drive was damaged beyond repair*)

The idea came from polymatt's Custom Apple II FloppyEMU disk drive. I wanted the aesthetic to match my IIGS, so I used the newer style of 5.25" drive. 

*The original faceplate can be found at [https://www.printables.com/model/432463-custom-faceplate-for-floppy-emu-apple-disk-2-build](https://www.printables.com/model/432463-custom-faceplate-for-floppy-emu-apple-disk-2-build)*

This required some serious modification of the plastic of the drive. I do not expect anyone else to replicate this project, but I am sharing the model for anyone to use.
