# FloppyEMU 5.25" Floppy Disk Faceplate

Model for a custom FloppyEMU case made from a repurposed Apple 5.25" floppy disk drive. (*The drive was damaged beyond repair*)

The idea came from polymatt's Custom Apple II FloppyEMU disk drive. I wanted the aesthetic to match my IIGS, so I used the newer style of 5.25" drive. 

*The original faceplate can be found at [https://www.printables.com/model/432463-custom-faceplate-for-floppy-emu-apple-disk-2-build](https://www.printables.com/model/432463-custom-faceplate-for-floppy-emu-apple-disk-2-build)*

*This project required some modification of the FloppyEMU board, some extreme modifcation of the Apple 5.25" Floopy Disk Drive, and a microSD card extension (found mine on Amazon). I don't anticipate anyone replicating this, but maybe the model will be useful for someone else's project.*
